# Egg Timer
Egg Timer is a really really simple IOS app to set a timer for boiling an egg so you will get a perfectly boiled level egg

### Purpose of this app
- For me to learn about IOS Development using Swift 5 and targeting IOS 13.0 or higher
- Because I love soft or medium egg, I always forgot that I'm boiling an egg so it's really wasting my time
- I love programming

### Main Flow of the App
1. Choose boiled level (soft, medium, hard)
2. Click boiled level then the progressbar will show up 
3. When the progressbar is finished, it will sound the alarm
4. Click on "Retry" button and it all will be resetted

Happy Coding!!!
